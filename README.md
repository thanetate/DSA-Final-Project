# DSA-Final-Project
NEW DSA PROJECT



INSTRUCTIONS:
Final project of my Data Structures and Algorithms class (CSCE 3110). 

GUIDELINES:
Dear Students,

This explains the basic requirements of the class group project.

We must implement a student management system and store student records in an in-memory data structure.

We must use two different data structures.

1. Linked List

2. Binary Search Tree


Requirements:

You must have the following features implemented.

1. add a student to the existing database.

2. Delete a student from the database once the student ID is given

3. search for a student with an ID

4. Search for a student with a name in case the student ID is not available

5. update student records when the student ID is given. This feature must allow the user to see the current information and a chance to modify any information except student ID.

 

Insert 100,000 students into the system. You can use a faker library to generate a list of students. 

One possible candidate is https://github.com/cieslarmichal/faker-cxxLinks to an external site.

Use this library to create a list of fake students with the following information

Name: The first name is enough

DOB:

Address: street

Address: city

Address: State

Address: zip

You may use other faker libraries, such as Python libraries, write them to a file, and later read it into a C++ program.

You must provide the answers to the following questions.

1. What is the run time of each operation (1 to 5 given above)for the Linked List and Binary Search tree?

2. Make a comparison between Linked List and Binary Search Tree.

 
Submission guidelines:

1. Submit your code as a zipped file. 

2. Document your system. Include some screenshots that display the five features that you implemented. Submit this doc file along side of your code file.
